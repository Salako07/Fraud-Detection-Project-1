# Fraud-Detection-Project-1
**Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning**
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

**Requirements**
1.Python 3.6 or above
2.Jupyter Notebook
3.pandas
4.scikit-learn
5.matplotlib
6.seaborn

**Usage**
Open the Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook fraud_detection.ipynb
Run the cells in the notebook to train the machine learning model and evaluate its performance.
Use the trained model to predict whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not.
